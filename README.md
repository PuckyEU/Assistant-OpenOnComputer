Guide on how to set up a Google Assistant command to open an application on your computer.

It will require manual setup and almost no coding.

## How to Setup the Google Assitant Command
- Open the Google Home app
- Go to the Automations Tab
- Create a new Automation:
  - Pick whether it will be a household or personal automation
  - Add a starter:
    - Pick the option `When I say to Google Assistant`
    - Type a catchphrase to open your program on the computer, but you might have to find a specific one that works for your case, because sometimes the assitant might confuse it with other commands.
  - Add an action:
    - Pick the option `Try adding your own`
    - Type `Open [your_ip_address]`. Replace the `[your_ip_address]` with your computer's IP address.
